🚘 1. Project Overview  
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming an essential part of the transition toward sustainable mobility.  
However, one of the biggest challenges faced by EV owners is **range anxiety** — the fear that the vehicle will run out of charge before reaching the destination.  

Our project focuses on addressing this issue by exploring how to **forecast the driving range of EVs** more accurately using data-driven approaches.  
The first step of our project is to clearly **identify and define the problem statement** that will guide all upcoming research and development.

🔍 2. Background Research  

What is Range Anxiety?  
Range anxiety is the concern or fear that an electric vehicle might not have enough battery charge to reach its destination or the next charging station.  
Although EV technology has improved, external factors like terrain, temperature, driving habits, and load continue to impact range significantly.

Why Is Range Forecasting Important?  
- Builds user confidence in EVs  
- Helps in efficient trip planning  
- Reduces unexpected breakdowns  
- Enhances the performance of energy management systems  

Gaps in Existing Systems  
- Dashboard estimates are not always accurate  
- Real-time environmental factors are often ignored  
- Lack of personalization based on driver behavior
